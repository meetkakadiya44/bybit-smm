        Orchestrates the order management process by comparing new orders against current ones,

        Steps:
        1. No current orders
            -> Cancel all (for safety), then send new orders

        2. All are bids/asks and have changed (extreme scenario)

        3. Current and new sides dont match (switching from/to extreme scenario)
            -> Cancel all and send all new

        4. 4 close to BBA orders have changed

        5. Outer orders have changed more than buffer
