    A base class for maintaining and updating an order book with ask and bid orders.

    Attributes
    ----------
    asks : NDArray
        A NumPy array to store ask orders. Each order is represented by a [price, quantity] pair.
    bids : NDArray
        A NumPy array to store bid orders. Each order is represented by a [price, quantity] pair.

    Methods
    -------
    sort_book():
        Sorts the ask and bid arrays by price in ascending and descending order, respectively.
    update_book(asks_or_bids: NDArray, data: NDArray) -> NDArray:
        Updates the order book (asks or bids) with new data.
    process(recv):
        Abstract method for processing incoming data. To be implemented by derived classes.

        ----------
        asks_or_bids : NDArray
